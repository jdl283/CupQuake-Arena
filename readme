Known issues/bugs
- Game runs poorly on lower end systems
- Nerds cannon hit registration does not work if the player is moving. 
- Frag registration is overall finicky. Sometimes it will not reward you for a frag and other times it will give you 4-5 frags for 1 frag.
- Gusher launcher kills do not count towards Frags.
- Momentum is preserved even when running into a wall. 
- Item pickups and moving platform positions are not synced across clients.
